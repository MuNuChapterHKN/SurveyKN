# SurveyKN
Welcome to SurveyKN! SurveyKN is an internal tool developed for Area HR to help HR members write reports for the periodic "Soddisfazione degli Associati". Its main purpose is to automate the most monotonous and downright boring parts of writing the reports. SurveyKN takes the answers given to the survey( in .csv format), and generates report templates( in .docx) format.
The tool is written in Python, however you don't need to know programming or Python to use it. All you need is a terminal and you're good to go.
